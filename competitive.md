# Competitive Programming and DSA

## How to start? (For absolute beginners):
-  Pick your IDE! for linux users, you can use your favourite text editor along with the terminal. Windows users can use codeblocks, VScode etc. There are few online IDEs as well if you don't want to waste any time setting up your envirounment. ideone.com and codechef.com/ide are the more popular ones.
- Pick your programming language! No language is better, it is only your prowess with it that will determine your performance. Even if you are unsure, continue with C for now. You will eventually figure out C++ very smoothly.
- [Learning Articles](https://github.com/priyankjairaj100/learning-articles/blob/master/CP1.md)
-  [Here](https://www.codechef.com/problems/school) you will find loads of simple problems for getting started. With not a lot of pre-requisites in terms of data structures, you won't find it very difficult to solve few problems and learn how to submit code.
- Pick 20 problems randomly and start solving. If you think it is getting repetitive, you can move on even sooner.

## (For moderately experienced coders):
- [Beautiful resource](https://www.codechef.com/certification/prepare)! Explore the syllabus through this intricate post by codechef. Then tackle each topic one at a time. PS: the foundation & advanved section should be sufficient for most of the problems expected in tests for internships.
- Take part in contests! You can try [Codeforces](https://www.codeforces.com) for starts. This is the best incentive to continue learning CP. Take part and find out for yourself! Codechef and Codeforces feature some really competitive contests with quality questions.
- GeeksForGeeks Blogs! While few of you are here for the incoming internship tests, GFG has written decent blogs targetted for people going for such tests. They have pointed out the popularly asked Algos and DSs. Pick a topic from the codechef article above, learn about it on GFG. Simple, right? Explore for yourselves!

## (For advanced topics):
- Know your syllabus! [This](https://slack-redir.net/linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fsharmaeklavya2%2F8aa2830f3a46a3f46ff249b4e1f07767) is a very extensive list of topics to be covered for solving the harder problems in contests.

## Right approach to problem solving:
Following these steps will take you a long way in the learning process.
- After you submit your code, ALWAYS check atleast two other correct codes by other users(if not more!). You will learn new techniques and diffrent coding styles from users all over. THIS IS A MUST.
- UPSOLVE THE CONTEST! telling from personal experience, this is one of the most efficient ways for a steeper learning curve. Solve all problems even after the contest is over. If you cannot, just see the solution or the editorial if you want to! Thats the only way to learn new things.
- Never run from topics you are uncomfortable with. (well, this kind of goes without saying.)
